# MFIFB-Multi-Focus-Image-Fusion-Benchmark
Multi-Focus Image Fusion Benchmark test

Multi-focus image fusion is an important area in image processing.
Although the development of image fusion algorithms has progressed considerably in recent years, there is still a lack of codebases and benchmarks to measure the state-of-the-art. In this paper, we present the Multifocus Image Fusion Benchmark (MFIFB) after briefly reviewing the recent advances in multifocus image fusion.
21 pairs of images, a codebase containing 3 fusion algorithms, and 6 evaluation metrics. We also conducted extensive experiments in this benchmark to understand the performance of these algorithms. By analyzing the qualitative and quantitative results, we identify effective algorithms for robust image fusion and provide some insights into the current state of the art in image fusion, and make some observations about the current state and future prospects of the field.
